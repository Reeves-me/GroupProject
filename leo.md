**My Interests**
- I chose a computer science major because I found it pretty interesting, but to be honest i didn't really have a major in mind up until the summer of my senior uear
- I spend most of my free time hanging out with my friends whether that is strolling around or playing video games
- I did track & field in high school and is still connected to many of my teammates from then
- I hope to learn more about game development, software engineering, and machine learning in my time here
- My favorite fruit is a close tie between watermelon and mangos
